This program converts (a variant of) Czech phonetic transcription to Devanagari.

There are two parts of the program:
 - A transcription library, under an MIT license
 - A Czech PyQt4-based GUI, under GPLv3

The GUI lives in gui.py, the library in the other files.
transl_table.py is a configuration file of sorts, it completely defines the
transcription process. It should be user-editable. If an error occurs in that
file, the hard-wired defaults from table.py get loaded in.

All Czech strings are in gui.py - translate them to another language if you
want to. If you do, you might also want to modify the (phonetic, r_phonetic)
tables in transl_table.py and table.py to better suit your keyboard.
